# PDF Delivery Events

Scholaro supports PDF delivery workflows for specific GPA report and digital evaluation events.

## Supported events

The following events are supported for PDF delivery:

- `gpa_report.created (pdf)`
- `gpa_report.updated (pdf)`
- `digital_evaluation.created (pdf)`
- `digital_evaluation.updated (pdf)`

These are listed separately from the `(data)` events on the Scholaro webhook page. See the [Events Reference](events-reference.md) for the event code behind each one.

## How it works

If PDF delivery is enabled, Scholaro saves a copy of the report whenever one of the supported events occurs.

A nightly Azure function then sends the saved report to the destination system and deletes the report from the storage container after processing.

## Slate delivery behavior

For Slate integrations, the existing integration flow remains the same. Enabling PDF delivery adds more files to the process rather than replacing the existing setup.
